Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors, a fun and interactive game built with Python! This project is perfect for beginners looking to explore programming concepts in a hands-on way. Ready to outsmart the computer and claim victory? Let’s get started! 🚀

🔗 How It Works

The rules are simple but timeless:

When prompted, type rock, paper, or scissor to make your move.

The computer will randomly choose its move.

The results are determined based on classic rules:

🪨 Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)

📜 Paper beats Rock (Paper wraps Rock)

✂️ Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)

If both players make the same move, it’s a Draw!

Type Q anytime to quit the game.

At the end, you’ll see how many rounds you won and how many the computer won. 🏆

✨ Why Play This?

Learn Python Basics: Master loops, conditionals, input/output, and randomization through a fun project.

Interactive Experience: Engage with Python in real-time while playing a game.

Sharpen Your Skills: Challenge yourself by modifying and enhancing the code.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and play:

Prerequisites

Python installed on your computer. Download Python here.

Instructions

Clone this repository or download the main.py file.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing the main.py file.

Run the script using the command:

python main.py

Follow the prompts, and have fun playing!

🔧 Key Features

Real-Time Gameplay: Immediate feedback after every move.

Win/Loss Tracker: See your performance at the end of the game.

Draw Detection: Recognizes when both you and the computer make the same move.

💡 Ideas for Exploration

Want to push your skills further? Here are some suggestions:

1. Add New Features

Track the number of draws.

Implement a "best of 3" or "best of 5" mode.

Allow users to set their name for a personalized experience.

2. Enhance the User Interface

Use Python’s colorama module to add color-coded text for results.

Include ASCII art for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

3. Introduce an AI Opponent

Replace the random computer choice with an AI that predicts the user’s moves based on previous patterns.

🎢 Concepts Covered

This project helps you understand:

Input/Output: Capturing user input and displaying results.

Conditionals: Making decisions based on game rules.

Loops: Repeating actions until the user decides to quit.

Randomization: Simulating the computer’s move.

🏆 What’s Next?

This game is just the beginning of your Python journey! Once you’re comfortable, try building more interactive projects like:

Tic Tac Toe

Number Guessing Game

Text-Based Adventure Game

The possibilities are endless, and each step takes you closer to becoming a Python pro! 🙌
